Sign Language Recognition Application

Welcome to the Sign Language Recognition Application! This project is an advanced machine learning system designed to recognize and interpret sign language gestures from pre-recorded videos or real-time webcam input. The goal of this project is to help bridge the communication gap for the hearing and speech impaired.

🌟 Features
🎥 Upload and Decode Videos: Upload a pre-recorded sign language video and get real-time results of the decoded gestures.
📹 Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Use your webcam to perform live sign language recognition directly in your browser.
🔍 Advanced Machine Learning Model: Built using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for robust spatial and temporal pattern recognition.
📊 Real-Time Feedback: Get instant feedback on detected gestures, whether through video uploads or live webcam input.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.7+
Flask
TensorFlow 2.x
OpenCV
MediaPipe
Node.js (optional, for additional frontend capabilities)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-recognition.git
cd sign-language-recognition
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up static and template files: Make sure your static and templates directories are correctly set up with the HTML, CSS, and JS files provided.

Run the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
flask run
The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

🧠 How It Works
The Sign Language Recognition Application uses a combination of deep learning models and computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures in videos or in real-time.

Hand Landmark Detection: Using MediaPipe, the system detects and tracks 21 key landmarks on each hand from the input video or live feed.
Feature Extraction: A CNN is applied to extract spatial features from the individual frames.
Temporal Modeling: LSTM layers are used to capture the sequence of gestures over time.
Prediction: The model predicts the gesture being performed based on the landmarks extracted from the input.
The backend is powered by Flask for easy deployment and interaction with the deep learning model.

Video Upload and Recognition

Real-Time Recognition via Webcam

🛠️ Usage
Upload Video for Gesture Recognition
Navigate to the Upload Video section from the homepage.
Select a pre-recorded video of a sign language gesture from your local machine.
Click the Upload and Decode button to see the recognized gesture.
Real-Time Gesture Recognition
Go to the Real-Time Recognition page.
Allow the app to access your webcam.
Click Start Recognition and perform sign language gestures in front of your camera to see the results in real time.
🧪 Model Details
The model used for gesture recognition is built using TensorFlow and consists of:

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for spatial feature extraction from individual frames.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for temporal sequence modeling to recognize gestures across multiple frames.
MediaPipe for real-time hand landmark detection.
The model is trained on a custom dataset of sign language videos and optimized for accuracy and speed.
